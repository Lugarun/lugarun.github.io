Hello all, I'm Lukas. I am constantly stuck between the desire to write a text editor, terminal multiplexor, markup language, Haskell machine learning library, and to work on my [NixOs](https://nixos.org/) configuration.
When I've managed to tear myself away from these obsessions.. um hobbies, I work on a statistical model for hardware validation at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/lukas-fridolin-schmidt).

I am an avid reader of blogs by people like [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/), [Chris Penner](https://chrispenner.ca/), [Dillon Chan](https://mosiman.ca/), [Julio](https://julio.lol/), and [Japorized](https://japorized.ink/). 
This site is my addition to the blogosphere that I love so much.

You can find some stuff on my [Github page](https://github.com/lugarun).

There are [RSS](/rss.xml) and [Atom](/atom.xml) feeds for this site.
