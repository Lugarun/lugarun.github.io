Hello all, I'm Lukas Schmidt.

I am currently a [graduate student at the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/lukas-fridolin-schmidt). I am mainly working on analyzing computer power consumption patterns of computers. I am hoping to be able to validate windows system logs using the computer's power consumption to detect log tampering by malware.

You can find my Github page [here](https://github.com/lugarun).
