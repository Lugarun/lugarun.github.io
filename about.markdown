Hello all, welcome to the blog of the ferocious nerd Lukas!
I dissolve into topics like:

- Bayesian Statistics, my [thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/19421) was on a Bayesian approach to novelty detection in high dimensional spaces
- Sampling, you're telling me that No U-Turn Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling isn't just as cool a use of new computing capabilities as transformers?!
- Lambda calculous-based hardware like the [reduceron](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/reduceron/), it seems like such a cool way around the von Neumann bottleneck
- Keyboards, specifically wireless split mechanical keyboards with screens on them
- Type systems, I want nothing more than a fast compiler for a dependently typed language that **I** understand
- Text, emacs and org-mode play a tug-of-war with Kakoune, markdown, and posix for my heart
- Reproducible research, at first this meant big org-mode files to me, now this means [NixOs](https://nixos.org/) environments with make files that generate final results from hashed data along with extensive use of git's features
- Language design, specifically that of [Unison](https://www.unison-lang.org/), [Idris2](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2), Haskell, and [ATS](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/atslangweb/)
- Yeast, I like my yeast in sour dough, apple cider, juices, and as a nutritional topping
